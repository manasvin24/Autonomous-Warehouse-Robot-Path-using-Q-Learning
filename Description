Warehouse Layout:

The warehouse is divided into 12 labeled locations (Aâ€“L) connected by pathways.
At any moment, each location may be assigned a priority rank from 1 (highest) to 12 (lowest), depending on factors such as customer urgency or product type.
The robot starts at any given location and must navigate to the highest priority location.

Key Features:

The agent must learn to navigate from any start point to any destination using the shortest path possible.
Optionally, the agent can stop at intermediary locations within the Top 3 priorities before reaching the top-priority location.
The system can dynamically change priorities, and the agent should adapt its pathfinding strategy accordingly.

Approach:

Use Q-Learning to train the agent on possible actions (move up, down, left, right) within a grid-like environment.
Reward the agent for reaching high-priority locations efficiently.
Penalize the agent for unnecessary moves or collisions with walls.
Implement optional logic for stopping by intermediary Top-3 priority points before final delivery.
